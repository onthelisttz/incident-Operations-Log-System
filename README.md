# Incident & Operations Log System (IOLS)

## Overview

The **Incident & Operations Log System (IOLS)** is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to reporting, tracking, and resolving operational incidents. It facilitates efficient incident management for organizations through role-based access control and detailed analytics.

The system is built using a modern decoupled architecture:
- **Backend**: Laravel (PHP) - providing a robust RESTful API.
- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript) - delivering a responsive and dynamic user interface.

## User Roles

- **Admin**: Full system access, including user management.
- **Operator**: Manages and resolves assigned incidents.
- **Reporter**: Reports incidents and tracks their status.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) & **npm**
- **PHP** (v8.2 or higher)
- **Composer**
- **MySQL** (v8.0 or higher)

## Getting Started

To set up the entire system, you will need to install and configure both the frontend and backend separately. Please follow the detailed guides below:

### 1. Backend Setup (API)
The backend handles data storage, authentication, and business logic.
[👉 Go to Backend Installation Guide](./backend/README.md)

### 2. Frontend Setup (Client)
The frontend provides the user interface for interacting with the system.
[👉 Go to Frontend Installation Guide](./frontend/README.md)

## API Documentation

The system includes comprehensive API documentation generated by **Scribe**.
Once the backend is running, you can access the documentation at:
`http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Quick Start (Assuming Prerequisites are met)

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```bash
cd backend
composer install
# If .env is missing:
# cp .env.example .env
# php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --seed
php artisan serve
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
# If .env is missing:
# cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
